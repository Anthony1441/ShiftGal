Reference waveband chosen is i
Number of stars in reference waveband 8
Skipping waveband g it does not have enough viable stars to use for realignment (1 stars)
Shifted waveband i by vector (0, 0) using 8 stars
Shifted waveband r by vector (0.6705200000000104, 0.047460000000000946) using 5 stars
Skipping waveband u it does not have enough viable stars to use for realignment (0 stars)
Skipping waveband z, stars disagree too much.
